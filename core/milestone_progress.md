## Milestone Progress Tracker

Milestone: Milestone 1 — Core Orchestration Backbone
Date: 2025-10-10

Status: In progress

Objectives:
- Implement orchestrator that produces a draft plan from user input (Planning Agent)
- Score the draft plan via Confidence Agent
- Persist plans, scores, and agent logs
- Minimal React UI to submit requests and view plan + confidence
- Hardware-aware model loading and logging

Current work items:
- Router / orchestrator fallback and telemetry (done)
- Persist fallback telemetry to AuditLog (done)
- Surface fallback summary in frontend (App.js modified) (done)
- Local model runtime validation and model loading (validated)

Next actions:
1. Align repository with Milestone 1 spec: review modules and ensure M1 features are present.
2. Persist `fallback_attempts` into `requests` table or `plans` row for per-request audit (planned).
3. Clean up temporary files and large media from branch before merging to `main` (this branch).

Issues being addressed:
- DetachedInstanceError when persisting audit logs (fixed)
- Unnecessary temp/test scripts left in repo (.tmp_*) — will be removed

How to use this file:
- Update this file on each checkpoint with date and short notes.
- Team members should link PRs and issue numbers in the log entries.
