   - Console tab
   - Type: `localStorage.clear()`
   - Press Enter
   - Refresh page (F5)

### Tools Not Working?

**Check backend logs for errors:**
```bash
# Look for import errors like:
# "pyautogui not installed"
# "selenium not installed"
```

**Install missing dependencies:**
```bash
pip install pyautogui selenium pillow
```

### Chrome Control Not Working?

1. **Install ChromeDriver** matching your Chrome version
2. **Check Chrome version:** chrome://version
3. **Download driver:** https://chromedriver.chromium.org/
4. **Add to PATH** or place in project root

### API Keys Not Working?

Your keys are already configured in .env:
- ✅ DEMO_OPENAI_KEY (working!)
- ⚠️ DEMO_ANTHROPIC_KEY (account disabled)

OpenAI models work fine. Anthropic/Claude models are disabled.
