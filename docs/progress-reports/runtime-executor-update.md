# Runtime Executor Update

**Date:** October 4, 2025
**Author:** automated-dev

## Summary

This progress report documents recent changes to the runtime executor and task validation for the LALO platform. Changes improve production readiness for model-backed agent execution.

## Changes

- Converted `RealExecutor` to an asynchronous executor (async def execute) to allow direct awaiting of `ai_service.generate` and non-blocking execution.
- Reworked `core/services/executor.py` worker loop to support both synchronous and asynchronous executors. When `executor.execute` is a coroutine function, the system runs an asyncio worker loop in a dedicated thread to handle tasks.
- Added basic API validation: `/api/runtime/agents/{agent_id}/assign` and `/api/runtime/agents/assign` now require the `task` payload to include a `prompt` field. If missing, the endpoints return HTTP 400.
- Added tests (`tests/test_runtime_task_validation.py`) covering:
  - Missing prompt validation on the orchestrator assign route (expect 400).
  - Async executor error handling: a test async executor that raises is used to verify the worker marks tasks as completed with an `error` result.

## Rationale

- Running model/backend calls via an async executor avoids blocking threads and simplifies graceful shutdown and scaling.
- Requiring `prompt` at the API boundary prevents invalid tasks from reaching executors and provides faster feedback to clients.

## Notes & Next steps

- RealExecutor currently bubbles exceptions; the worker converts them into error results recorded on the task. Next steps include adding per-task timeouts, retries, and improved observability (metrics/tracing).
- Consider moving the in-process worker to an external task queue (Redis/Celery/RQ) for production scaling and resilience.
