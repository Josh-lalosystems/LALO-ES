# LALO AI - Codebase Audit
**Date**: 2025-10-04
**Purpose**: Identify reusable components vs. what needs rebuilding

---

## ✅ KEEP (Functional & Reusable)

### Database Models (`core/database.py`)
- ✅ **User** - Basic user model with relationships
- ✅ **Request** - AI request tracking
- ✅ **UsageRecord** - Usage analytics
- ✅ **Feedback** - User feedback collection
- ✅ **APIKey** - Encrypted API key storage
- ✅ **WorkflowSession** - Full 5-step LALO workflow (already exists!)
- ✅ **WorkflowState** enum - Proper state machine definition
- ✅ **Encryption setup** - Fernet for API keys
- **Action**: Extend with new tables (tool_executions, agents, data_sources, audit_logs)

### Authentication (`core/services/auth.py`)
- ✅ **JWT token generation/validation**
- ✅ **Demo mode support**
- ✅ **get_current_user dependency**
- **Action**: Keep as-is, add RBAC layer on top

### AI Service (`core/services/ai_service.py`)
- ✅ **OpenAI/Anthropic model wrappers**
- ✅ **Model initialization per user**
- ✅ **Token usage tracking**
- **Action**: Keep, extend with tool calling support

### Key Management (`core/services/key_management.py`)
- ✅ **Encrypted API key storage**
- ✅ **Key validation**
- ✅ **Get/add/delete operations**
- **Action**: Keep as-is

### Pricing Service (`core/services/pricing.py`)
- ✅ **Cost calculation per model**
- ✅ **Token pricing**
- **Action**: Keep as-is

### Database Service (`core/services/database_service.py`)
- ✅ **Session management**
- ✅ **Usage recording**
- **Action**: Keep, extend with new tables

### Microservices (`rtinterpreter/`, `mcp/`, `creation/`)
- ✅ **RTI** - Recursive task interpreter (working)
- ✅ **MCP** - Model control protocol (working)
- ✅ **Creation** - Artifact creation (working)
- **Action**: Keep, integrate properly into workflow

### Frontend Components (Partially)
- ✅ **DevLogin.tsx** - Auth UI
- ✅ **Navigation.tsx** - Sidebar navigation
- ✅ **APIKeyManager.tsx** - Key management UI
- ✅ **UsageMonitor.tsx** - Usage tracking UI
- **Action**: Keep admin/settings components, rebuild chat interface

## 🔧 MODIFY (Needs Extension)

### Workflow Routes (`core/routes/workflow_routes.py`)
- ⚠️ **Exists but incomplete** - Has basic start/approve/reject endpoints
- ⚠️ **Missing**: Tool integration, streaming, full orchestration
- **Action**: Extend with complete workflow orchestrator integration

### AI Routes (`core/routes/ai_routes.py`)
- ⚠️ **Basic chat endpoint exists**
- ⚠️ **Missing**: Tool calling, streaming, proper error handling
- **Action**: Rebuild as modern chat API with tool support

### Frontend WorkflowChat (`lalo-frontend/src/components/WorkflowChat.tsx`)
- ⚠️ **UI exists but disconnected from actual workflow**
- ⚠️ **Too basic** - Not enterprise-grade design
- **Action**: Rebuild as professional chat interface with workflow integration

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Backup current database**: `cp lalo.db lalo.db.backup`
2. **Create new migrations** for extended schema
3. **Build core workflow** (Steps 2-8)
4. **Implement tools** (Steps 9-16)
5. **Rebuild chat UI** (Steps 35-40)
6. **Add security/agents/connectors** (Steps 17-34)

**Estimated work**: 60-70% new code, 30% reuse existing
**Priority**: Workflow system > Tools > UI > Everything else
