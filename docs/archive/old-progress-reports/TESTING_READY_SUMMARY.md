## ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Warnings (Non-Critical)

These warnings appear during tests but **do not affect functionality**:

1. **SQLAlchemy Deprecation:** Using old `declarative_base()` style
   - **Impact:** None (works perfectly)
   - **Action:** Upgrade to SQLAlchemy 2.0 style when convenient

2. **Pydantic V1 Validators:** Using deprecated `@validator` decorator
   - **Impact:** None (works perfectly)
   - **Action:** Migrate to `@field_validator` when convenient

**Bottom Line:** System is production-ready despite these warnings. They're just future-proofing notices.

npm install

# Build
npm run build
```

### If tests fail:
```bash
# Run specific test
python -m pytest tests/test_specific.py -v

# Run with full output
python -m pytest tests/ -v --tb=long

# Check imports
