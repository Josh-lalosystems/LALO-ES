# Fix Summary - API Key Provisioning & AI Request Flow

## Date: October 4, 2025

## Problem
When submitting AI requests through the frontend, users were being redirected to the login page instead of getting responses. The error was: "API key authentication failed. Please check your API keys in Settings."

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **API Key Auto-Provisioning Logic Error**
- **File**: `core/services/auth.py`
- **Issue**: The auto-provisioning code was calling a non-existent method `key_manager.add_api_key()`
- **Fix**: Changed to use the correct `key_manager.set_keys()` method with proper `APIKeyRequest` object

### 2. **Multiple Backend Processes**
- **Issue**: Multiple old uvicorn processes were running on port 8000 simultaneously
- **Impact**: Requests were being routed to old instances without API keys provisioned
- **Fix**: Used `start_all.ps1` script to properly kill all processes and start fresh

### 3. **Anthropic API Account Disabled**
- **Status**: User's Anthropic/Claude account is currently disabled
- **Workaround**: System now works with OpenAI-only configuration

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `core/services/auth.py` (Lines 72-93)
**Before:**
```python
key_manager.add_api_key(user_id, {...})  # Method doesn't exist!
```

**After:**
```python
from core.services.key_management import key_manager, APIKeyRequest
from pydantic import SecretStr

key_request = APIKeyRequest(
    openai_key=SecretStr(demo_openai) if demo_openai else None,
    anthropic_key=SecretStr(demo_anthropic) if demo_anthropic else None
)
key_manager.set_keys(user_id, key_request)
```

### 2. Added Debug Logging to `core/routes/ai_routes.py` (Line 141)
```python
print(f"[AI_SERVICE_ERROR] {type(e).__name__}: {error_msg}")
```

### 3. Updated `.env` Configuration
```bash
DEMO_MODE=true
DEMO_OPENAI_KEY=sk-proj-...
DEMO_ANTHROPIC_KEY=sk-ant-...  # Currently disabled
```

## Current Status

### ✅ Working
- Backend API server running on port 8000
- API key auto-provisioning for demo user
- OpenAI GPT models (gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4-turbo-preview)
- AI request/response flow
- Usage tracking and cost calculation
- Demo mode authentication bypass

### ⚠️ Limited
- Anthropic Claude models (account disabled - will return errors)
- Only OpenAI models currently functional

### ❌ Still TODO (Next Phase)
- Agent Builder UI integration
- Marketplace UI integration
- Enhanced Chat Interface
- Data Connectors UI
- Frontend navigation updates for new features

## Test Results

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test Request
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/ai/chat \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt":"Say hello","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","max_tokens":10}'

# Response (SUCCESS)
{
  "id": "62bbf8ae-aeda-48b7-a718-4742a3a1e1e4",
  "response": "Hello! How can I assist you today?",
  "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 2,
    "completion_tokens": 9,
    "total_tokens": 11
  }
}
```

### Available Models
- ✅ gpt-4-turbo-preview (OpenAI)
- ✅ gpt-3.5-turbo (OpenAI)
- ⚠️ claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 (Anthropic - account disabled)
- ⚠️ claude-3-opus-20240229 (Anthropic - account disabled)
- ⚠️ claude-3-haiku-20240307 (Anthropic - account disabled)

## How to Use

### Starting the System
```bash
# Recommended: Use the startup script (handles port cleanup)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File start_all.ps1 -Backend

# Alternative: Direct start
python app.py
```

### Accessing the Application
- Frontend: http://localhost:8000
- API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
- Health Check: http://localhost:8000/docs#/

### Making AI Requests

#### In Demo Mode (DEMO_MODE=true)
No authentication required! Just submit requests directly.

#### With Authentication
1. Get demo token: `POST /auth/demo-token`
2. Use token in requests: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

## Files Modified
1. `core/services/auth.py` - Fixed API key auto-provisioning
2. `core/routes/ai_routes.py` - Added error logging
3. `.env` - Added DEMO_OPENAI_KEY and DEMO_ANTHROPIC_KEY

## Files Created (Testing/Debug)
- `test_provision_keys.py` - Manual key provisioning test
- `test_openai_direct.py` - Direct OpenAI API test
- `test_ai_flow.py` - Complete request flow test
- `test_get_current_user.py` - Auth function test

## Known Issues
1. **Anthropic Account Disabled**: Claude models will fail with authentication error
2. **Frontend Navigation**: New features (Agent Builder, Marketplace, Chat) not in menu yet
3. **Alembic Missing**: Database migrations skipped (not critical for demo)

## Next Steps

### Immediate (< 1 hour)
1. ✅ Fix API key provisioning (DONE)
2. ✅ Test AI request flow (DONE)
3. ⏳ Test from browser UI
4. ⏳ Verify request submission doesn't redirect to login

### Short-term (1-2 days)
1. Add Agent Builder to navigation
2. Add Marketplace to navigation
3. Add enhanced Chat UI to navigation
4. Add Data Sources to navigation
5. Rebuild frontend with new routes
6. Configure OpenAI-only mode (disable Anthropic features)

### Medium-term (3-5 days)
1. Implement Agent Builder backend
2. Implement Marketplace backend
3. Implement Chat UI streaming
4. Add Data Connectors
5. Self-improvement feedback loop
6. Complete end-to-end testing

## Success Metrics Achieved
- ✅ Backend starts without errors
- ✅ Database initialized with demo user
- ✅ API keys auto-provisioned from environment
- ✅ AI requests complete successfully
- ✅ Usage tracking records data
- ✅ OpenAI models functional

## Conclusion
The core API key provisioning issue has been resolved. The system now successfully auto-provisions API keys for the demo user from environment variables and processes AI requests end-to-end. The main remaining work is frontend integration of the new features built in steps 27-43.
