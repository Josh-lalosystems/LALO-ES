# Third-party licenses and attribution

Generated from `requirements.txt` and `requirements-ml.txt` on 2025-10-05.

This project includes third-party libraries. Those libraries are licensed under
their respective licenses and must be used and redistributed in accordance
with those terms. The list below is an inventory (not a legal statement) of
libraries referenced by this project; verify each license text and attribution
before distributing the software.

See `THIRD_PARTY_DEPENDENCIES.md` for the PyPI-reported license metadata.

Important notes:
- Some packages (Apache-2.0, MIT, BSD) permit commercial use but require you to
  preserve license text and attribution when distributing those components.
- If you intend to redistribute third-party packages bundled with the product,
  include their license texts in your distribution and honor their conditions.

Recommended actions before commercial distribution:
1. Identify any GPL-family or other copyleft packages (none obvious in the
   requirements but verify transitive dependencies).
2. For each included third-party package, keep its license text in the
   distribution (in a `licenses/` folder or in the documentation).
3. Consult legal counsel if you plan to relicense or remove third-party code.

Contact licensing@lalo-ai.com for commercial licensing inquiries.
