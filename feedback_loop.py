Module: FeedbackLoop

Purpose:
 - Collect feedback from human approvals and tool execution outcomes.
 - Train a reward model using RLHF design to refine agent decision-making.
 - Re-deploy updated policy (HRM or LLM) as feedback accumulates.

Dependencies:
 - Reward memory store (database or in-memory storage)
 - RL training engine (e.g. PPO, actor-critic)
 - AuditLogger for logging tuning events
 - Baseline LLM or HRM policy to fine-tune

Edge Cases:
 - Sparse feedback: buffer until sufficient data before training
 - Model divergence: validate updates against baseline behavior
 - Feedback noise: filter low-quality or inconsistent approval results
