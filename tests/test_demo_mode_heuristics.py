Smoke Test for DEMO_MODE Heuristic Routing

This test validates that the router correctly classifies requests in DEMO_MODE
when no actual AI models are available. It ensures the heuristic fallback logic
works as expected for common user queries.

Run with:
    pytest tests/test_demo_mode_heuristics.py -v
    python -m pytest tests/test_demo_mode_heuristics.py -v -s
